              <h3>Our work</h3>
              <p>In keeping with its goals, in March 2007 the members organized a culturally sensitive breast cancer education event at the Masjid in Porterville, California. The Islamic organization consisted of primarily Yemeni immigrants, many of whom are not literate in English. The program was organized in cooperation with Blue Cross of California and the American Cancer Society. Information was presented for men and women, separately.</p>
              <p>In June of 2008, the foundation made its exploratory visit to Gujarat, India. In a short period, the members were put in contact with a Non-Governmental Organization by the State Health Minister's office. The NGO, Shree Bhrahma Samaj Seva Trust and the PFF were successful in organizing an education seminar/workshop for about 60 women.</p>

              <p>The NGO had invited local physicians to participate and has motivated the local chapter of the Rotary International to partner with PFF for future projects.</p>

              <p>The event was covered extensively by the local media and has contributed in spreading the awareness of early breast cancer detection.</p>

              <p>Tejal Pandya, one of the co-founders of the PFF partnered with Monache High School Interact Club and the Porterville School District Governing Board in July 2008 in sending over 500 pounds of educational materials to Roots for Kids, an orphanage in Cameroon, Africa. Among the materials sent, were textbooks, story books and educational material on hygiene, nutrition and disease prevention. Roots for Kids is a non-profit in the process of building a new school for the orphans in Cameroon and the books will help get the library started for the children.</p>

              <p>In October 2008, PFF sponsored the annual Relay for Life even in Porterville, California, a fundraiser organized by the American Cancer Society.</p>
